## 🔎 About Me

Full-stack developer with solid experience in Java, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.  
I work across the entire stack using Spring, Django, Node.js, and React, and I handle both SQL and NoSQL environments.  
I operate confidently in high-scale, distributed, event-driven architectures using RabbitMQ, Redis, Docker, and cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure.

Curious by nature, analytical by habit, and always oriented toward clean architecture, maintainability, and performance.
